# LVM Analysis
Repo containing MEGA related code.

MEGA_Numpy.py (for numpy arrays) and MEGA_Pytorch.py (for torch tensors) can be imported to use the MEGA function that returns 1MEGA and 2MEGA. These should be clean and commented.

The repo also contains the code used for the article demonstrations which are not commented unfortunately.
